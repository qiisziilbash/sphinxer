### Welcome to my sphinx repo.

This repository holds demos for my youtube video tutorials on sphinx

You need these to use reproduce:
 - sphinx
 - jupyter
 - recommonmark
 - sphinx_rtd_theme

You can use ***pip*** to install these packages.
I would suggest to create a virtualenv to not mess up your other python packages.
